# Amazon_Manager

This is an Amazon accounts manager meant to be the final project for CSC 1401 "Computer Programming 1".

- Before accessing the interface, the user must either login or signup.
- Once signed in, the program interacts with the user in a loop that allows the user to perform the following actions:
  
    1)	Change user information
    2)	Make order
    3)	Complete order
    4)	Delete account

Note: The file database.txt contains in every row the profile information of the users.
